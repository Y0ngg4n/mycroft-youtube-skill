# Contributing Guide
### Most Cases
For 99% of contributions which are about any of the following, just do a standard pull request.
- Bug fixes
- Quality improvements
- Translations
- Improving platform support

I will be enthused that someone's *actually* made a pull request and we'll discuss adding it in after a brief code review.

### New Features
Before implementing new major features, please discuss your proposal with me first. That way, when it comes time to 
look over the code, we generally won't run into too many big surprises which could result in the feature being rejected 
or requiring heavy reworking.
